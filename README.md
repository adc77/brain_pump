## Project Description:
This project is an Android app developed in Android Studio using Java and XML. The app aims to provide a chat-based interface for users to interact with a language model, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, to learn and ask questions on various topics.

## Features
Initial Screen: The app starts with an initial screen that displays a button labeled "Know it all!" <br/>
<br/>
Chat Interface: Upon clicking the button, the app opens a chat layout where users can interact with the language model. <br/>
<br/>
Text Input and Output: Users can type their queries or input in the chat interface, and the language model provides text-based responses. <br/>
<br/>
API Integration: The app integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo using the OpenAI API key to leverage its language processing capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
Future Enhancements: The project has plans to extend its features, including adding speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output options. It aims to provide users with the flexibility to switch between speech-only, text-only, or both modes simultaneously. <br/>
<br/>
Multimodal Learning: The app's focus on multimodality aims to enhance the learning experience by incorporating multiple modes of communication, such as text, speech, and visuals, to facilitate efficient learning.
